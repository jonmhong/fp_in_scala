# fp_in_scala

These are the exercises done while going through [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653/ref=sr_1_2/131-2819082-8053251?ie=UTF8&qid=1547194633&sr=8-2&keywords=functional+programming+in+scala)

I used [this repo](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) as a guide, hint, and answer sheet.
